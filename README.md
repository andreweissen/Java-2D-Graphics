### CMSC 405 Java 2D Graphics ###

#### Overview ####

This project, created for CMSC 405 Computer Graphics, is a simple application of basic Java 2D graphics transformation operations like rotate, scale, and translate. These operations are undertaken on a collection of three distinct user-created images assembled by methods and stored in two-dimensional arrays. The completed project was submitted on August 31, 2018 and received a grade of 100%. The package itself contains images of the program in action, documentation files containing a more detailed decription of the project goals, and the three Java source files themselves.
